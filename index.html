          <p>
            Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language,
            offering much more structure and support for large programs than
            shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python
            also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a
            very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in,
            such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more
            general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem
            domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy
            in Python as in those languages. Python allows you to split your
            program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It
            comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use
            as the basis of your programs — or as examples to start learning to
            program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file
            I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user
            interface toolkits like Tk. Python is an interpreted language, which
            can save you considerable time during program development because no
            compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used
            interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of
            the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions
            during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk
            calculator. Python enables programs to be written compactly and
            readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than
            equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations
              in a single statement;
            </li>
            <li>
              statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and
              ending brackets;
            </li>
            <li>no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="Using_the_Python_Interpreter">
          <header>Using the Python Interpreter</header>
          <p>
            The Python interpreter is usually installed as
            /usr/local/bin/python3.9 on those machines where it is available;
            putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it
            possible to start it by typing the command:
          </p>
          <code class="example">python3.9</code>
          <p>
            to the shell. 1 Since the choice of the directory where the
            interpreter lives is an installation option, other places are
            possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator.
            (E.g., /usr/local/python is a popular alternative location.)
          </p>
          <p>
            On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the
            Microsoft Store, the python3.9 command will be available. If you
            have the py.exe launcher installed, you can use the py command. See
            Excursus: Setting environment variables for other ways to launch
            Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typing an end-of-file character (Control-D on Unix, Control-Z on
            Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a
            zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter
            by typing the following command: quit().
          </p>
          <p>
            The interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing,
            history substitution and code completion on systems that support the
            GNU Readline library. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether
            command line editing is supported is typing Control-P to the first
            Python prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command line editing;
            see Appendix Interactive Input Editing and History Substitution for
            an introduction to the keys. If nothing appears to happen, or if ^P
            is echoed, command line editing isn’t available; you’ll only be able
            to use backspace to remove characters from the current line.

        <section class="main-section" id="An_Informal_Introduction_to_Python">
          <header>An Informal Introduction to Python</header>
          <p>
            In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the
            presence or absence of prompts (>>> and …): to repeat the example,
            you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears;
            lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the
            interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an
            example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a
            multi-line command. Many of the examples in this manual, even those
            entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in
            Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of
            the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or
            following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A
            hash character within a string literal is just a hash character.
            Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by
            Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.
          </p>
          <code class="example">
            <em># this is the first comment</em> <br />
            spam = 1 <em># and this is the second comment</em> <br />
            <em># ... and now a third!</em> <br />
            text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."

        <section class="main-section" id="More_Control_Flow_Tools">
          <header>More Control Flow Tools</header>
          <p>
            Besides the while statement just introduced, Python uses the usual
            flow control statements known from other languages, with some
            twists.
          </p>
          <h3>If Statements</h3>
          <p>
            Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For
            example:
          </p>
          <code class="example">
            <span>x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))</span> <br />
            <span>if x < 0:</span> <br />
            <span>&emsp;x = 0</span> <br />
            <span>&emsp;print('Negative changed to zero')</span> <br />
            <span>elif x == 0:</span> <br />
            <span>&emsp;print('Zero')</span> <br />
            <span>elif x == 1:</span> <br />
            <span>&emsp;print('Single')</span> <br />
            <span>else:</span> <br />
            <span>&emsp;print('More')</span> <br />

              and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix
              .py appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is
              available as the value of the global variable __name__.None,
              reverse=False)
            </li>
            <li>list.reverse()</li>
            <li>list.copy()</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Dictionaries</h3>
          <p>
            Another useful data type built into Python is the dictionary (see
            Mapping Types — dict). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other
            languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike
            sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are
            indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and
            numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they
            contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any
            mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a
            key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in
            place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like
            append() and extend().
          </p>
          <p>
            It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs,
            with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one
            dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}.
            Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces
            adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way
            dictionaries are written on outputA module is a file containing
            Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name
            with the suffix .py appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as
            a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__.
            del. If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value
            associated with that key is forgotten. It is an error to extract a
            value using a non-existent key.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Modules">
          <header>Modules</header>
          <p>
            If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the
            definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost.
            Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are
            better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the
            interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is
            known as creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may
            want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may
            also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several
            programs without copying its definition into each program.
          </p>
          <p>
            To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and
            use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the
            interpreter. Such a file is called a module; definitions from a
            module can be imported into other modules or into the main module
            (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script
            executed at the top level and in calculator mode).
          </p>
          <p>
            A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The
            file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. Within a
            module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of
            the global variable __name__.

          <header>Input and Output</header>
          <p>
            There are several ways to present the output of a program; data can
            be printed in a human-readable form, or written to a file for future
            use. This chapter will discuss some of the possibilities.
          </p>
          <h3>Fancier Output Formatting</h3>
          <p>
            So far we’ve encountered two ways of writing values: expression
            statements and the print() function. (A third way is using the
            write() method of file objects; the standard output file can be
            referenced as sys.stdout. See the Library Reference for more
            information on this.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Often you’ll want more control over the formatting of your output
            than simply printing space-separated values. There are several ways
            to format output.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To use formatted string literals, begin a string with f or F
              before the opening quotation mark or triple quotation mark. Inside
              this string, you can write a Python expression between { and }
              characters that can refer to variables or literal values.
            </li>
            <code class="example">
              >>> year = 2016 <br />
              >>> event = 'Referendum' <br />
              >>> f'Results of the {year} {event}' <br />
              'Results of the 2016 Referendum'
            </code>
            <li>
              The str.format() method of strings requires more manual effort.
              You’ll still use { and } to mark where a variable will be
              substituted and can provide detailed formatting directives, but
              you’ll also need to provide the information to be formatted.
            </li>
            <code class="example">
              >>> yes_votes = 42_572_654 <br />
              >>> no_votes = 43_132_495 <br />
              >>> percentage = yes_votes / (yes_votes + no_votes) <br />
              >>> '{:-9} YES votes {:2.2%}'.format(yes_votes, percentage)
              <br />
              ' 42572654 YES votes 49.67%' <br />
            </code>
            <li>
              Finally, you can do all the string handling yourself by using
              string slicing and concatenation operations to create any layout
              you can imagine. The string type has some methods that perform
              useful operations for padding strings to a given column width.
            </li>
            <p>
              When you don’t need fancy output but just want a quick display of
              some variables for debugging purposes, you can convert any value
              to a string with the repr() or str() functions.
            </p>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Errors_and_Exceptions">
          <header>Errors and Exceptions</header>
          <p>
            Until now error messages haven’t been more than mentioned, but if
            you have tried out the examples you have probably seen some. There
            are (at least) two distinguishable kinds of errors: syntax errors
            and exceptions.
          </p>
          <h3>Syntax Errors</h3>
          <p>
            Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most
            common kind of complaint you get while you are still learning
            Python:
          </p>
          <code class="example">
            >>> while True print('Hello world') <br />
            &emsp;File, line 1 <br />
            &emsp;&emsp;while True print('Hello world') <br />
            SyntaxError: invalid syntax
          </code>
          <p>
            The parser repeats the offending line and displays a little ‘arrow’
            pointing at the earliest point in the line where the error was
            detected. The error is caused by (or at least detected at) the token
            preceding the arrow: in the example, the error is detected at the
            function print(), since a colon (':') is missing before it. File
            name and line number are printed so you know where to look in case
            the input came from a script.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Classes">
          <header>Classes</header>
          <p>
            Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.
            Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new
            instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have
            attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances
            can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its
            state.

            Compared with other programming languages, Python’s class mechanism
            adds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics. It is a
            mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3. Python
            classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented
            Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base
            classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class
            or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with
            the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of
            data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature
            of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further
            after creation.

            In C++ terminology, normally class members (including the data
            members) are public (except see below Private Variables), and all
            member functions are virtual. As in Modula-3, there are no
            shorthands for referencing the object’s members from its methods:
            the method function is declared with an explicit first argument
            representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call.
            As in Smalltalk, classes themselves are objects. This provides
            semantics for importing and renaming. Unlike C++ and Modula-3,
            built-in types can be used as base classes for extension by the
            user. Also, like in C++, most built-in operators with special syntax
            (arithmetic operators, subscripting etc.) can be redefined for class
            instances.
